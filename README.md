DANAE is a deep Denoising AutoeNcoder for Attitude Estimation which works on Kalman filter IMU/AHRS data integration with the aim of reducing any kind of noise, independently of its nature. Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06853
Further experiments will work on the Extended KF, improving also the architecture of the method.
