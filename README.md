### DANAE: Description

DANAE is a deep Denoising AutoeNcoder for Attitude Estimation which works on Kalman filter IMU/AHRS data integration with the aim of reducing any kind of noise, independently of its nature.
Further experiments will work on the Extended KF, improving also the architecture of the method.
